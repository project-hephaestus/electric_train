	The branch version are named after 500kV busses on the WECC system.
	The following GridLAB-D branches are planned and/or released:

	- <b>Allson</b>: this is the developmental release for the charter partners
	  of the initial release
    - <b>Buckley</b>: this is the planned first release for the public after
	  the charter partners have completed their first modules.

	@section License
	GridLAB-D is provided under a BSD-style license modified appropriately
	for government-funded software.  See legal_license() for details.

	The	restrictions forbid the removal of the copyright and legal notices.
	This is not actually a restriction, but a reminder of what goes
	without saying in a world where common sense is more common.

	The	restrictions also preclude the use of any contributor's name as an endorsement.
	This should not be interpreted as an actual restriction either, but a clarification
	because without the clause, the license does not grant recipients of the
	software permission to use the licensor's name anyway.  But it makes the legal
	types happy.  That's a good thing.

	See \ref License "The GridLAB License" for details.
