	This file contains the definition for 4 types of lines, their configurations
	and the conductors associated with these lines.  The line is one of the major
	parts of the method used for solving a powerflow network.  In essense the
	distribution network can be seen as a series of nodes and links.  The links
	(or lines as in this file) do most of the work, solving a series of 3
	dimensional matrices, while the nodes (defined in node.cpp) are containers
	and aggregators, storing the values to be used in the equation solvers.
	
	In general, a line contains a configuration that contains a spacing object, and
	one or more conductor objects, exported as phaseA_conductor, phaseB_conductor, 
	phaseC_conductor, and phaseN_conductor.  The line spacing object hold 
	information about the distances between each of the phase conductors, while the 
	conductor objects contain the information on the specifics of the conductor 
	(resistance, diameter, etc...)
	
	Line itself is not exported, and cannot be used in a model.  Instead one of 3
	types of lines are exported for use in models; underground lines, overhead lines,
	and triplex (or secondary) lines.  Underground lines and overhead lines use the
	basic line configuration and line spacing objects, but have different conductor
	classes defined for them.  The overhead line conductor is the simplest of these
	with just a resistance and a geometric mean radius defined.  The underground
	line conductor is more complex, due to the fact that each phase conductor may
	have its own neutral.  
	
	Triplex lines are the third type of line exported.  A special triplex line
	configuration is also exported which presents 3 line conductors; l1_conductor,
	l2_conductor, and lN_conductor.  Also exported is a general insulation 
	thickness and the total diameter of the line.  The conductor for triplex lines
	is much the same as the overhead line conductor.
	
	All line objects export a phase property that is a set of phases and may be 
	set using the bitwise or operator (A|B|C for a 3 phase line).
